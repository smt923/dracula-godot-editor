# Dracula theme for Godot editor

Simply copy `Dracula.tet` to the Godot editor theme directory:

- On Linux: `~/.config/godot/text_editor_themes/`
- On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Godot/`
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%\Godot\text_editor_themes\`

The theme will then show up in your editor's settings, under `Text Editor` then `Theme` (for Godot 3.0 - for earlier versions I'm sure it's somewhere similar)

I can't figure out how to color certain symbols and not others so some colors aren't exactly how the 'Dracula look' should be, and I may have miscolored some functions and types compared to the Dracula spec, but I like how it turned out and the colors seem to fit well regardless, but feel free to make a PR if you spot any improvements to the theme
